## Overview       

The application provides mapping data with time series data visualization for Oregon HABs. This guide describes the application features and steps for using the application.

## Application features and usage   

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE}
#devtools::install_github('rstudio/rmarkdown')
library(rmarkdown)
library(jpeg)
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/ygrund/ygrund_C_Users/PROJECTS/HABs/userGuide/userGuide.jpg")

```


1.	Click on the **toggle button** ![](C:/Users/ygrund/ygrund_C_Users/PROJECTS/HABs/userGuide/toggleButton.jpg) to extend or collapse the side bar that contains three options: ![](C:/Users/ygrund/ygrund_C_Users/PROJECTS/HABs/userGuide/about.jpg) “About”, ![](C:/Users/ygrund/ygrund_C_Users/PROJECTS/HABs/userGuide/guide.jpg) “User Guide” and ![](C:/Users/ygrund/ygrund_C_Users/PROJECTS/HABs/userGuide/contact.jpg) “Contact”.       

2.	**Select a Date** from the calendar to display CyAN satellite data on the map for the selected date. Default date selected is the latest day of the available data. On the calendar, only the dates with data are available for selection. On the top of the calendar, click on the title to move up from month to year, and click the left or right arrows to move to previous or later periods.              

3.	**Select a Waterbody** from the drop-down list to display a map within the extent of the selected waterbody. Default selection on the drop-down list is "Oregon", which corresponds to the Oregon view in the center of the map. The waterbodies in the drop-down list are the satellite resolvable lakes (see Limitations at the end of this Guide for details). The waterbodies are organized by alphabetical order. Each waterbody is named as "waterbody name_GNISID". Once a waterbody is selected, a text under the drop-down box will appear to show whether this waterbody is within or not within a drinking water source area.     

4.	**Boxplot** shows the cyanobacteria abundance of the selected waterbody on the selected date. A red line indicates the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline (100,000 cells/mL) for cyanobacteria in recreational freshwater. When the default waterbody in the field of “Select a Waterbody” is "Oregon" or when a selected waterbody has no data on a selected day, no boxplot shows. Otherwise, hover the mouse icon over the boxplot to display the values of minimum, median, maximum, 1st quartile (25th percentile) and 3rd quartile (75th percentile) of cyanobacterial abundance (cells/mL) of the selected waterbody on the selected date.       

5.	**Map** provides a visualization of the CyAN satellite data on the selected date. Default map shows Oregon view in the center of the map. The map refreshes in correspondence with the selected date or the selected waterbody. The lakes outlined in blue are the resolvable lakes. The lake name will show in blue text in the popup label when mouse moves over the lake. Four control buttons at the upper-left corner of the map allow users to (1) zoom in, (2) zoom out, (3) reset to Oregon map view with regardless of any selection of date or waterbody, (4) open up the layer options. In the layer options, user can choose the base maps between OpenStreetMap and ESRI National Geographic World Map, check "Hydrologic Unit 8 (HU8)" to display the USGS HC8 watershed boundaries on the map, and/or check "Land Cover (NLCD2016)" to overlay the land cover layer on the map. See [National Land Cover Database 2016 (NLCD2016) Legend][Legend]. If "Hydrologic Unit 8 (HU8)" is checked, the HU8 watershed name will show in purple text in the popup label when mouse moves over the map. Check "Value" in (4) the map layer popup window to display cyanobacteria abundance value, the raster cell value, when mouse moves over the map (see the red arrows). The detection threshold is 6310 cells/mL. The value equal or less than this threshold is reported as "Non-detect". An insert map, a legend and a scale bar are also displayed. Double-click on the map to zoom in to the clicked area.

6.	**Date Range** allows users to choose a range of dates to display time series plot of cyanobacteria abundance of selected waterbody. Default starting date is the first date of the entire dataset and the default ending date is the last date with available data of the entire dataset.       

7.	**Summary Statistics**, including daily maximum, daily mean and daily minimum, are available for users to select to display on the time series plot of cyanobacteria abundance of the selected waterbody. Default selection is daily mean of cyanobacteria abundance.        

8.	Select **y-axis Log Scale** to display the data in log-scale on the time series plot of cyanobacteria abundance for the selected waterbody. Default y-axis is not log-scaled.       

9.	**Time series plot** displays daily mean, daily maximum and/or daily minimum values of cyanobacteria abundance (cell/mL) for the selected waterbody during the selected date range. A red line on the plot indicates the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline (100,000 cells/mL) for cyanobacteria in recreational freshwater.        

10.	**Table** shows the data corresponding to the time series plot based on selections of date range and summary statistics. The detection threshold is 6310 cells/mL. The value equal or less than this threshold is reported as "Non-detect". Click the up-down-arrows next to the table column name to sort the information as desired. Click the **Download** button to download the table in CSV, Excel and PDF format.        

## Limitation

This application uses satellite imagery data from the European Space Agency Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite Ocean and Landcolor Instrument (OLCI). A satellite image is a geo-referenced TIFF formatted raster file. Each pixel cell represents a 300m x 300m area. Therefore, only lakes large enough can be accurately "resolved" by the satellite. 

In addition, satellite imagery data can be influenced by bottom reflectance of shallow waterbody and cloudiness. Data in this application should be interpolated with consideration of lake morphology and weather condition.
